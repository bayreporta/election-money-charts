Pretty Money
=====================

An EdSource data-driven app. Crunches campaign finance data and spits out visualizations based on what kinds of data you want displayed. Built for California campaign finance disclosures. Uses GSheets via Tabletop.js as database.

App is meant to be as non-coder friendly as possible upon completion. Goal is to allow campaign finance reporters, and others interested in this kind of data, a method to easily turn data into visualizations. 

Has been featured at EdSource, Santa Rosa Press-Democrat, and Lost Coast Outpost. 

Currently in <strong>BETA</strong>. Mucho work needs to be done.
